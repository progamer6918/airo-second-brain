AIRO Current State
Active Focus
AIRO Second Brain: being upgraded into a shared canonical knowledge base / AIRO Kernel.
Earesmes/Hermes: local WSL AI agent via Telegram, intended as the main local operator node.
AIRO Finance: active project, but canonical status lives in the vortex-ai-skill-lab repo.
Owner Preferences Quick Reference
Owner-facing communication: Bahasa Indonesia.
Preferred execution style: safe, explicit, no hallucinated status.
Coding skill assumption: owner is beginner; commands must be copy-paste friendly.
Do not overwrite local changes without approval.
Do not claim PASS or DONE without evidence.
Distill knowledge; do not dump raw chat into canonical files.
Different consumers should behave as one AIRO operator across tools.
Current Architecture Decision

AIRO Second Brain is not a raw transcript dump.

Use this layer model:

inbox/ = session closeout capture.
state/ = current active context.
decisions/ = final and pending decisions.
projects/ = project pointers and summaries.
identity/, systems/, agents/, meta/ = stable operating knowledge.

## Active Workstream: Report Automation VBA

Primary active workstream: Report Automation VBA.

Relevant project file:

- `projects/report-automation-vba.md`

Related registry:

- `systems/repository-registry.md`

Current focus:

- Stabilize Excel/VBA Command Center report automation.
- Preserve the confirmed R4/R5 Monitoring Dealer baseline.
- Extend the same `SALES_5PIVOT` engine to Report Per Type with formula-safe handling.
- Keep Result VE as `MAPPING_REQUIRED` until its Data Model, connection, external Master Data, and formula staging mapping are completed.

Current rule:

AIRO Second Brain is the canonical knowledge hub. Repository-specific work may live in other repos, but durable operator context should be summarized or linked from this repo.

## AIRO Second Brain v0.4.1 status
- **Status:** Phase 3 (Sync & Preflight) PASS.
- **Next Step:** Phase 4 Bootstrap & Organize.
